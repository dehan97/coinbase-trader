# Coinbase machine learning trading project
My platform integrates various components, including database management, data processing, machine learning algorithms, and a user-friendly client interface to offer a comprehensive solution for cryptocurrency trading.

# Overview
Our platform harnesses the power of advanced technologies to fetch real-time cryptocurrency data, process it through various technical analyses, apply machine learning models for predictive insights, and present these findings through an intuitive user interface. This end-to-end solution is aimed at providing traders with the tools they need to make informed decisions.

# Features
Database Management: Utilizes a robust database system to store and manage vast amounts of cryptocurrency data efficiently.
Data Processing: Employs sophisticated algorithms to process and analyze data, extracting valuable insights from complex market trends.
Machine Learning: Integrates cutting-edge machine learning models to predict market movements and identify trading opportunities.
Client Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface that offers a seamless experience for accessing analyses and predictions.

# Components
1. Database Manager (dbmgr.py)
Manages all interactions with the database, ensuring secure and efficient data storage and retrieval.

2. Data Processor (dataprocessor.py)
Processes raw market data, computes various technical indicators, and prepares the data for machine learning analysis.

3. Machine Learner (machinelearner.py)
Applies machine learning algorithms to processed data to generate market predictions and trading signals.

4. Client Interface (client.py)
A user-friendly client application that allows users to interact with the system, view market analyses, and receive trading recommendations.

5. Backtester (backtester_pt1.ipynb)
A Jupyter notebook that provides functionality for backtesting trading strategies using historical data to evaluate performance.

# Getting Started
To get started with the platform, follow these steps:

Set Up the Database: Initialize the database using dbmgr.py.
Process Data: Run dataprocessor.py to fetch and process the latest market data.
Train Models: Use machinelearner.py to train predictive models with processed data.
Launch Client: Start the client application from client.py to access market insights and predictions.
